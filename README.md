This is one of my projects from my `Web Dev Journey` which is a `Weather App` which uses free API from "OpenWeather" to display weather forecast according to city name.
This project manages the data fetched from my personel OpenWeather API KEY and displayed the required information according to the searched city name.

This project makes me understands about:-<br>
  •How to use API to fetch information.<br>
  •How to manage API data.<br>
  •How to use API KEY to use data.<br>
